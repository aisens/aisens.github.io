On thursday we started working with Processing. Programming was like in Pascal, but there was differences too. I worked in Pascal two years ago, thats why I forgot big part of programming.
By using this sources (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3235343/Teaching/GettingStartedWithProcessing.pdf,http://processing.org/), I learned alot about processing and tried to create a monster.
It was challenging, because you must draw by writting coordinates, but you can't see them on drawing window. Eventually thanks to sources and the help of my classmates I drew my monster.
Here is it.

He is ugly, I know.
