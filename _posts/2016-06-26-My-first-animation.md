Continuing working with processing on friday we tried to make animations. Firstly we started from making ellipse move. It wasn't difficult, but it was hard to remember all things. Here is ellipse random moving [animation](aisens.github.io/Moving). The most nteresting thing,that it changes it's color when it is moving. Because color dependes on location by coordinates. \
Next animation is animated picture. Colorful ellipses appearing same with colors on picture. Here is my [example](aisens.github.io/Jake). I used picture of Jake, because he is my lovely cartoon character.
Creating animations very interesting, I hope I will learn to create another types of animation.
