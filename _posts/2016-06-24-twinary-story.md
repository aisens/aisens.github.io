Yesterday we with Zarina have worked on a project in Twinary. It was very interesting experience, because we devided our work and allways connect to make our work linked. She was writting the story in Twinary and I helped her with the plot. I also worked on an art box. I tried use minimum colours as it is possible, moreover I wrote story and rules of the game on backside of the art box. 
  Main character in our stiry was little ninja octo cat. We have shorten his name like Ninjocat. Story telling you about his unfair destiny and his rebirth. Hope you will enjoy reading "Ninjocat".
