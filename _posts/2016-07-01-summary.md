From 20 June to 1 July we students from all over Kazakhstan had Standford cources named "Engineering and Game Design".
It was great experience for everyone. Thanks to our fabulous teacher from Standford we learned a lot of interesting things like: 
game creating, developers, design, engineering, using tools and technology Arduino, Processing, Sploder, and Twine. Moreover we learned how to be googlish.
Work in team, help each other and as Miss Sherol says " Team succed if every member of team succed".  
In class we did activities whitch in Google does. For example, Lock Activity, Party Game,Who am I?, "Rock, paper, scisors" and egg problem.
