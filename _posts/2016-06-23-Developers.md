Developers:

A producer organizes work of all team. He is a manager, a provider. Thanks to this developer all members of the team orderly. He also makes everyone's work more efficient.

A designer makes blue prints. He is important because he plans work of engineer and artist. Thanks to his plan maintained the connection between their work.

An engineer is the highest paid job, because they are few. This developer performs the function of builder.

A scientist evaluating work of all team. He collects the data and keep it all together. He is important because he makes theories and finds ways to make their work better.

An artist creates the visual elements of a game, such as characters,objects, vehicles, surface textures, clothing, and even user interface components. 

My favourite developers is artist and designer, because their work connected with art and designing. I also like planning that why designer job close for me.
